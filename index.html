                    The growth rate in Australia is steadily increasing. <br> <br>
                    However, significantly more people are <span class='bold'>moving into high density areas</span> and <span class='bold'>out of low density areas</span>.

                    This can be visualised by the positive correlation between population and percentage growth rate. <br>
                    This issue is particularly severe in <span class='vic'>Victoria</span> but not as present in <span class='qld'>Queensland</span>.

                    The only year where people where moving out of the cities was 2021. This was the most evident in <span class='vic'>Melbourne</span>. <br> <br>
                    Throughout every other year, people were <span class='bold'>moving away from the regional districts</span> and <span class='bold'>into city centres</span>.

                    However, the rate at which new buildings are constructed is decreasing! <br><br>
                    The largest housing developer used to be <span class='nsw'>NSW</span> but it has significantly fallen behind the other states (shown on the right).

                    Australian Growth is primarily lead by <span class='immit'>immigration</span> followed by <span class='nat'>natural growth</span> (births and deaths). 
                    <br><br>
                    This caused the growth rate to significantly reduce during the Covid-19 Pandemic. However, the growth rate has quickly rebounded in the last few years.
                    <br> <br>
                    Most Migration occurs from parts of <span class='bold'>Asia</span> due to its closer proximity. Howevver, there are also a significant number of people coming from <span class='bold'>Colombia</span> and <span class='bold'>Ireland</span>.
                    <br><br>
                    The graph to the left shows the contribution to Australian growth. The map below shows the amount of people that migrated to Australia in 2019.
